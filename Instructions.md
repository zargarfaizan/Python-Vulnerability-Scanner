1. *Install Dependencies*
Install the necessary Python libraries:
`pip install python-nmap requests fpdf`

2. *How the Code Works*
*scan_network*: Uses nmap to scan a target IP for open ports and services.
*fetch_cve*: Uses an API to fetch known vulnerabilities for each service detected.
*generate_report*: Generates a professional-looking PDF report with scan results and vulnerabilities.

3. *Running the Project*
*Run the script*
`python vuln_scanner.py`
Input a target IP/domain when prompted.
The script will scan the network, fetch vulnerabilities, and generate a PDF report with the results.


4. *Project Expansion*

Im planning to add these features in future. Feel free to comment if you come up with any idea. You comments are much appreciated. 
*Integrating with a real CVE database*: Use APIs like NVD (National Vulnerability Database).
*Adding more scan options*: Allow scanning of specific ports, services, or network ranges.
*Automating patch suggestions*: Provide recommendations based on detected vulnerabilities.
